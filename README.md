# team-generator

I created this app to test [bun](https://bun.sh/), [htmx](https://htmx.org/) and [shoelace](https://shoelace.style/) ğŸ¤“

Add members and divide them into teams, where each team will get a reandom team name ğŸ«¸ğŸŒŸğŸ«·

## Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

## Run

```bash
bun run start

```

## Dev

```bash
bun run dev
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.3. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
